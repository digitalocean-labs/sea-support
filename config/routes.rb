  # LEARNING NOTE: RESTful Resources
  # This creates all standard CRUD routes for tickets
  # GET /tickets (index), GET /tickets/new (new), POST /tickets (create),
  # GET /tickets/:id (show), GET /tickets/:id/edit (edit),
  # PATCH/PUT /tickets/:id (update), DELETE /tickets/:id (destroy)

      post :bulk_apply_responses # POST /tickets/bulk_apply_responses - Apply suggested responses to multiple tickets
